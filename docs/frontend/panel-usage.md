# Monitoring Data

We also provide monitoring real-time data of meters. To access the panel, you can open the link `http://youdomain:port/monitor`.

## Get Started

Once you open the page, it starts grabbing data from the server. By default, it doesn't select any data to present, so you need to open the `configuration` by clicking the button at the bottom of the page and select data you want to display in the chart.

The monitor can run in multiple tabs, which means you can display different kinds of data simultaniously by opening multiple windows / tabs in your browser and selecting different topics. 

## Pausing and Resuming

You can stop collecting at any time and resume collecting by clicking the button to the right of `configuration`.

## Gaps

Due to our design of backend collectors, there are gaps between data. It is the expected behavior of the collector (for reducing the pressure of backend server and panel servers).
